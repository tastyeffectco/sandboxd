# Changelog

All notable changes to sandboxd are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: a minor bump adds features,
a patch is fixes only).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-22

Reliability of the Docker + SQLite core (Phase 0) and the durable app model
(Phase 1).

### Added
- **Durable app model.** Apps are now first-class entities above sandboxes. An
  app owns the user-facing concept (name, description, tags) and outlives the
  sandbox that is its current running instance. New tenant-scoped `/v1/apps` API
  (`POST` / `GET` / `GET {id}` / `PATCH {id}` / `POST {id}/sandbox`) with optional
  `external_*` integration tags; sandboxes gain a nullable `app_id`. Additive and
  backwards-compatible — the existing sandbox API is unchanged. (#31)
- **Selectable app templates.** A working Vite + React + TypeScript
  `react-standard` scaffold ships in the image at `/opt/templates/<name>` and is
  seeded into a new workspace on first boot (default `react-standard`;
  `template: "blank"` for an empty workspace). The agent now edits a known-good
  app with a passing build and a live preview instead of scaffolding from an
  empty directory. (#29)
- **Per-task timeout.** `timeout_s` on `POST /v1/sandboxes/{id}/tasks` (0 or
  omitted → 10m default, max 24h). The control-plane task watcher now derives its
  streaming window from the task timeout instead of a fixed 15 minutes, so long
  tasks are no longer marked failed prematurely. (#25)
- **Per-sandbox idle policy.** `idle_policy: sleep | always_on`. (#14)
- **End-to-end + image-smoke CI.** A job that builds the base image and drives
  the real create → seed → install → serve → wake lifecycle on a Docker daemon,
  and asserts the agent CLIs and the default template are present on the image.
  Adds `go vet` to the Go job. (#30)

### Fixed
- **Snapshot capture** targeted the old loopback `.img` model and returned 500 on
  the default directory-storage workspaces; it now copies the workspace tree
  crash-consistently and round-trips through `from_snapshot`. (#24)
- **`POST /v1/sandboxes`** returned `400` on a clean install because it forced an
  unseeded `react-standard` template; a no-template create is now provisioned
  cleanly. (#28)
- Four confirmed correctness items from the security/code audit. (#21)

### Changed
- The image installs Claude Code via the official native installer, alongside
  OpenCode. (#18)

### Removed
- The dormant single-token auto-git-push path (undocumented, unused). (#23)
